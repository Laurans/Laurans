## Hi 👋 My name is Anaëlle Laurans

### Data engineer 

I started my career in data science and machine learning. but I wanted to be more on the technical side. So now I am working as data engineer. 

Archived repositories are from my past interests for reinforcement learning.

- 🌍 I'm based in France
- 🎯 My goals are to deliver good quality data on which people can trust, and to automate repeting things I do in my developer's life
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and Godot Engine for fun.
